                Hi Natalie, we talked about countries that you have stayed in the past, there's so many of them! Can you give us a list of them and where will you define where you are from?

                <div class="m1answer">
                 I’ve lived in Ecuador, USA, Dominican Republic, Panama, Brazil, and Uruguay. <br>Now I definitely think Ecuador is where I identify I am from, and it always feels like home.

               What are the qualities/characteristics that you consider the most important of a place?

            <div class="m1nat">NK
                <div class="m1answer">
                Definitely a sense of feeling at home, just because when you move around a lot you want to find a place to feel somewhat as a home to you.

               Maybe give a ranking of places where it has the best food and which dish specifically that earned your compliment?

                <div class="m1answer">
              First would be Ecuador just because I love Ecuadorian food just as bolon, tigrillo, and seafood. Then I would pick Brazil for their delicious meat, especially the picana. Also, they have this cheese bread that is called pao de queijo which is delicious.

                    VY: Can you tell us about the journey you have exploring the media?

                    <div class="m2answer">
                    NK: I use pencil and pen primarily.
                    By using pencil and pen I would draw a lot in the borders of my homework or classwork.
                    <br><br>
                    My favorite material when doing my artwork is pen, especially stabilo pens and also black pens that have different points.

                    <div class="m2question">
                    <br>VY: Have you thought about cross media(digital+analog)?
                    </div>
                    <div class="m2answer">
                    NK: I have, but I’m not a fan. I’m just not a digital person when creating art. I think it’s because I’m new to it and it scares me to try. I also know that I need a lot of practice towards it.

                    <br>VY: Since you are now trying with digital tools, do you have any expectations about it? Will you consider transforming analog to digital?

                    <div class="m2answer">
                    NK: I’m nervous and excited about it because it's something new and i don’t want to fail at it. I personally don’t think I will transfer to analog or digital but who knows maybe if I have more practice and it's fun maybe I will create more towards it.

                    VY: This next question could sound a little too broad, but yeah, I still want to hear what you think. So, why do you make art?

                    NK: I do art because it’s fun...I love everything about it.

                    ...And I always enjoy doodling on my notebook, like the borders of the textbook. When I draw on the textbooks the teacher will just tell me to stop but I just feel like finishing it.

                    <div class="m4name">
                    It started at a young age, back in the art classes and I just saw the teacher doing art and stuff that made me want to achieve what she does... There so many mediums that can be explored and create amazing artworks.

                    <div class="m4name">
                    NK: Exactly. Then I found myself experimenting with a lot of materials. And I feel I am most creative when I do classes, you know?(chuckles)

                    VY: I feel resonated with the in-class drawing, like many artists tend to create new reality to sort of escape.
                    Finally, we have our last question here, what message do you hope to convey through your work?
